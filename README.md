# Node.js & Express API Boilerplate

This project is a comprehensive, best-practice boilerplate for creating scalable and maintainable Node.js applications with Express. The structure is designed to be logical and easy to navigate, promoting a clear separation of concerns by isolating the API layer, business logic, and data access layer.

The core application logic lives inside the `src` directory to keep it separate from configuration files, tests, and other project metadata.

## ✨ Features

  * **Scalable Folder Structure**: A professional structure that separates API (routes, controllers), services (business logic), and repositories (data access).
  * **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between the Express app configuration (`app.js`) and the server startup logic (`server.js`), which is crucial for testing.
  * **Centralized Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables for different environments (development, production).
  * **Asynchronous Database Setup**: Modern, promise-based SQLite setup using `async/await` to prevent race conditions.
  * **Data Access Layer**: Isolates all database queries in a `repositories` folder, making it easy to switch databases in the future.
  * **Database Seeding**: Includes a seeding script with `@faker-js/faker` to populate the database with realistic test data.

## 🚀 How a Request Flows

Here’s how a `POST` request to `/api/user` travels through the application:

1.  **`server.js`**: Starts the server, which listens for incoming requests.
2.  **`app.js`**: Receives the request. It has been configured to route any path starting with `/api` to the appropriate router.
3.  **`api/routes/user.routes.js`**: Matches the `POST /user` endpoint and calls the `userController.createUser` function.
4.  **`api/controllers/user.controller.js`**: The `createUser` function extracts data from `req.body` and calls `userService.createUser(userData)`. The controller's job is only to manage the request and response, not to perform business logic.
5.  **`services/user.service.js`**: The `createUser` function contains the business logic. It validates the data, checks if the user already exists, and finally calls `userRepository.create(newUser)`.
6.  **`repositories/user.repository.js`**: The `create` function executes the `INSERT INTO users (...)` SQL query against the database.
7.  **Response**: The result bubbles back up the chain, and the controller sends a `201 Created` status and the new user data back to the client.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file and set your desired `PORT`.

    ```
    # .env
    PORT=3000
    ```

    **Important**: The `.env` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally committing sensitive information.

4.  **Seed the database:**
    Run the seed script to populate your SQLite database with 20 fake users.

    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

5.  **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    The server will start, and you should see the message: `Server running on port 3000`.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, the following scripts are available:

  * `"start"`: Starts the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the application when file changes are detected.
  * `"seed"`: Runs the `seed.js` script to populate the database with initial data.

## Endpoints API

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

| Method  | Endpoint      | Description                  |
| :------ | :------------ | :--------------------------- |
| `GET`   | `/users`      | Retrieve all users.          |
| `GET`   | `/user/:id`   | Retrieve a single user by ID.|
| `POST`  | `/user`       | Create a new user.           |
| `PATCH` | `/user/:id`   | Update an existing user.     |
| `DELETE`| `/user/:id`   | Delete a user by ID.         |
